# Machine Learing and Data Science
1) **Naive Bayes classifier** for categorical data from scratch in Python 
2) **Naive Bayes classifier** for continuous data from scratch in Python 
3) **Data Visualization:** Showing Iris dataset with Blender API
4) **Norms in vector space:** A review of norms, and reminding p-norms are included. Finally, we compare some special p-norms.
5) **Inner products in vector space:** Reminding dot product and Frobenius inner product, and then canonical norms based on them. There are examples with module *numpy*.
6) **Gram-Schmidt** process: An algorithm to convert a linearly independent set of vectors into an orthogonal set of vectors.
7) **Boxplot:** The elements of a **boxplot** are reviewed here, including: medians, quartiles, fences, and outliers.
8) **Probability, standard terms:** such as sample space, trial, outcome, and event.
9) **Logisitic function:** It is an S-shaped curve, which is widely used in machine learning and neural networks.
10) **Sigmoid functions (curves):** Some examples are included. They are widely used in neural networks and deep learning.
11) **Conditional probability:** We review the conditional probability and based on it, we get the multiplication rule. 
12) **Inclusion-exclusion principle:** We review this principle both in set theory and in probability. Python code is also provided. 
13) **Probability, independent events:** The property of independent events are mentioned here. Also, multiplication rule is included with some examples.
