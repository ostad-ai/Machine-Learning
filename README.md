# Machine Learing and Data Science
1) Naive Bayes classifier for categorical data from scratch in Python 
2) Naive Bayes classifier for continuous data from scratch in Python 
3) Data Visualization: Showing Iris dataset with Blender API
4) Norms in vector space: A review of norms, and reminding p-norms are included. Finally, we compare some special p-norms.
5) Inner products in vector space: Reminding dot product and Frobenius inner product, and then canonical norms based on them. There are examples with module *numpy*.
