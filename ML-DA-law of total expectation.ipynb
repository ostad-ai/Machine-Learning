    "### Probability: law of total expectation \n",
    "\n",
    "The Law of Total Expectation is a fundamental rule in probability that relates the expected value of a random variable to its conditional expectations. For two random variables $X$ and $Y$, the law states that:\n",
    "<br>$E[X]=E[E[X|Y]]$\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **discrete random variable** $Y$, the law of total expectation becomes:\n",
    "<br>$E[X]=âˆ‘_y P(Y=y)\\cdot E[X|Y=y]$\n",
    "<br>where $P(Y=y)$ is the probability of the random variable $Y$ takes the value $y$. Moreover, $E[X|Y=y]$ is the expected value of $X$ given that $Y=y$.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **continuous random variable** $Y$, the law of total expectation becomes:\n",
    "<br>$E[X]=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} E[X|Y=y]\\cdot f_Y(y)dy$\n",
    "<br>where $f_Y(y)$ is the probability (density) function (PDF) of $Y$.\n",
